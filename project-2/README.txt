E63a:

For this problem I used a scanner that would be used to take a string as input.
For this problem and multiple other problems on this project, I used the 
StringBuilder method found in Java documentation. I used this as a way to print each
output on the same line as a string instead of all on separate lines, making the output
more concise in the terminal. 

I also used .isWhitespace and .isUpperCase to detect "space" characters and uppercase characters.

For this problem I used a scanner that would be used to take a string as input.
For this problem and multiple other problems on this project, I used the 
StringBuilder method found in Java documentation. I used this as a way to print each
output on the same line as a string instead of all on separate lines, making the output
more concise in the terminal.

I used a loop that iterates through the user-inputted string and checks whether 
each character has a remainder when its index (with one added to account for the starting zero) is divided by 2.
If there is no remainder, then the character is one of "every second letter."

StringBuilder method found in Java documentation. I used this as a way to print each

I used setCharAt to change each vowel to an underscore. Each vowel is found by looping
through the string and checking each character against a list of vowels.

E63d:

For this problem I used a scanner that would be used to take a string as input.
I used a loop to check for vowels, and then incremented a variable by 1
each time a vowel was found in order to get the total number.,

E63e:

For this problem I used a scanner that would be used to take a string as input.
I used a loop to check for vowels, and then printed the index to document
what position the vowels are at.
